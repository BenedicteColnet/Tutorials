# Tutorials
Contains notebooks that compute from scratch classic machine learning and statistics functions. Focus on Causal Inference functions.


For now it contains:

- Classic linear regression (R)
- Logistic regression from scratch (R)
- ATE estimation from RCT (Difference in means and OLS) with a simulation to illustrate variance properties (R)
- IPW notebook with 2 ways to compute propensity scores, and two simulations (one complex and one easy). Stratification is also proposed. (R)
- M-estimation tutorial for geex with reproduction of Lunceford & Davidian (2004) simulations
